1. Harris Detector
	- Basic Idea:
		- Look at a small window of pixels, to tell the difference between edge pixels and corner pixels
		- Shift the window and calculate the change of intensities for the window
			- *Edge*: change of intensity along just one direction
			- *Corner*: change of intensity along both directions
