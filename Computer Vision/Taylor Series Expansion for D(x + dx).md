Sure! To obtain the Taylor series expansion of the function $D(\mathbf{x} + \Delta \mathbf{x})$ around the point $\mathbf{x} = (x, y, \sigma)$, we need to compute the first few derivatives of D with respect to each variable x, y, and $\sigma$ at that point.

Let's start by defining the partial derivatives of D with respect to each variable:

$$\frac{\partial D}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} - \sigma \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma} \right]$$

$$\frac{\partial D}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} - \sigma \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma} \right]$$

$$\frac{\partial D}{\partial \sigma} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial x}^2 + \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}^2 \right) \right]$$

where L is the image gradient magnitude function. Note that we are assuming here that D depends on x, y, and $\sigma$ only through its dependence on L.

Using these partial derivatives, we can now write the Taylor series expansion of D around the point $\mathbf{x} = (x, y, \sigma)$ as follows:

$$D(\mathbf{x} + \Delta \mathbf{x}) = D(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{\partial D}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac{\partial D}{\partial y} \Delta y + \frac{\partial D}{\partial \sigma} \Delta \sigma + \mathcal{O}(\Delta \mathbf{x}^2)$$

where $$\Delta \mathbf{x} = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta \sigma)$$ is the displacement from the point $\mathbf{x} = (x, y, \sigma)$.

Note that the last term in the expansion is the remainder term, which represents the error introduced by truncating the series after the third term. This error term is typically small when $\Delta \mathbf{x}$ is small, which is why the Taylor series expansion is often used to approximate functions in the vicinity of a given point.
